TASK 3:NUMBER RECOGNITION

TASK DESCRIPTION:

Number Recognition :
Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects
scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit
recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made
with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects
the scanned images of handwritten digits.

Dataset Used : "MNIST" Dataset
About Dataset: The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)

"MNIST" is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and computer vision research, which consists of a set of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into two sets: a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The training set is used to train a machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
